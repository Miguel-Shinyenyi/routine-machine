# Doc Maintenance Rules

This file controls how every other doc in this project gets written and updated. Read this
before touching any code.

## Best practices rule

Every structural decision follows current, reasonable practice for small backend and ML
services, not personal preference. When a decision is made, the doc entry states which
practice it follows and why it applies here. If it's unclear or debated, say so in the Open
Questions section instead of picking arbitrarily.

## Core rule

Every code change that adds, removes, or changes behavior comes with a doc update in the
same turn. No exceptions. Docs describe the current state of the system, not the history of
how it was built. Old approaches get deleted from the doc, not commented out.

## When to update which file

- New or changed API endpoint: update `backend.md`
- New or changed database table, column, or index: update `database.md`
- New suggestion rule, pattern-detection logic, or model: update `intelligence-service.md`
- New test category or coverage decision: update `testing.md`
- Any phase starting or finishing: update the Status log table in `PROJECT.md`

## Format for each component doc

1. **Purpose**, one paragraph, what this component does and why it exists
2. **Current state**, what is built right now, described plainly
3. **Decisions log**, a table of decisions made and why, most recent first
4. **Open questions**, anything unresolved that affects this component

## Decisions log format

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|------|----------|--------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | What was decided | Why, in one sentence |

## Rules for writing these docs

- No filler. State what exists, not what might exist someday.
- Describe the system the way you'd explain it to another engineer joining the project.
- Keep each doc under 300 lines. If it grows past that, split it into sub-files and link them.
- When something is removed or replaced, delete the old description. Do not leave dead
  documentation in place.

## How this gets used

When work resumes on this project in a new session, read `PROJECT.md` first, then read the
specific component doc for whatever is being worked on. That's enough context to continue
without re-explaining the whole system.
